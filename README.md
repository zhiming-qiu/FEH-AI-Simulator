# FEH-AI-Simulator

An attempt at creating a tool that simulates AI behaviour in Fire Emblem Heroes.

# NoTICE

I'm currently working on Dijkstra's Algorithm in another one of my repositories, which will be needed for AI decision-making here.

The Dijkstra's Algorithm can be found in [release page](https://github.com/EachOneChew/Dijkstra-s-Algorithm-FEH/releases). Go pick up a release and find the jar link in asset section, eg [Assets|distance-calculator.jar](https://github.com/EachOneChew/Dijkstra-s-Algorithm-FEH/releases/download/v0.2-alpha/distance-calculator.jar). Once you grab the jar file, put in folder `lib` in current repo and run your main class by specifying classpath as `java -classpath lib/distance-claculator.jar Main`.
